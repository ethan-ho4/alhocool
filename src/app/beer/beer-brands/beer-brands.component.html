Established in 1876 by Adolphus Busch and his friend Carl Conrad, this St. Louis-born brew was inspired by the Bohemian lager of the Czech Republic. With its distinct red label and the iconic Clydesdale horses, Budweiser has been a staple at American celebrations for generations. While it's often referred to as a light, crisp lager, the brewing process is anything but simple. It involves an exclusive beechwood aging process that imparts a smoothness to the final product.</p><br>
