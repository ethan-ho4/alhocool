    <div class="content">

        <div class="red-wine">
            <p class="title-red">Red Wine:</p>
            <p class="vibe-red">The Vibe: Romantic candlelit dinners, soft jazz in the background, and intimate conversations.</p>
            <p class="content-red">Red wine, with its deep hues and robust flavors, is the ideal companion to hearty dishes. Imagine savoring a perfectly cooked steak, its juices melding with the rich notes of a Cabernet Sauvignon. Pasta dishes, especially those with rich tomato or meat sauces, find their match in red wines like Merlot or Chianti. And for those with a sweet tooth, the surprising pairing of dark chocolate truffles with a glass of red can be a delightful experience, with the bitterness of the chocolate enhancing the wine's fruity undertones.</p><br>

        <div class="white-wine">
            <p class="title-white">White Wine:</p>
            <p class="vibe-white">The Vibe: Beachside luncheons, gentle sea breezes, and the sound of waves crashing.</p>
            <p class="content-white">White wine, often celebrated for its light and crisp flavors, pairs best with dishes that carry a hint of delicacy. Seafood dishes, whether it's a creamy lobster bisque or grilled salmon, are elevated when accompanied by a chilled Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. Poultry dishes, especially chicken in creamy sauces, harmonize with the subtle notes of white wines. And for a refreshing appetizer, a cheese platter featuring soft cheeses like goat and feta, paired with a Pinot Grigio, sets the tone for a delightful meal.</p><br>

        <div class="rose">
            <p class="title-rose">Ros√©:</p>
            <p class="vibe-rose">The Vibe: Garden parties, floral dresses, and laughter under the sun.</p>
            <p class="content-rose">Ros√©, with its beautiful pink hue, is the picnic champion. Envision a sunny day, a basket filled with strawberry salads with a hint of balsamic, grilled prawns marinated in herbs, or a Mediterranean mezze with olives, hummus, and pita. The fruity and floral notes of a Ros√© complement these dishes, making every bite feel like a summer's day.</p><br>

        <div class="sparkling-wine">
            <p class="title-sparkling">Sparkling Wine:</p>
            <p class="vibe-sparkling">The Vibe: Grand celebrations, twinkling lights, and the sound of glasses clinking.</p>
            <p class="content-sparkling">Sparkling wine, synonymous with celebrations, is versatile in its pairings. The effervescence of a Prosecco or Champagne is a match for oysters, their bubbles enhancing the oceanic flavors. Sushi, with its mix of textures and flavors, dances beautifully with the crispness of sparkling wine. And for a fun twist, pairing it with salty fries brings out a play of flavors, the saltiness contrasting with the wine's sweetness.</p><br>

        <div class="dessert">
            <p class="title-dessert">Dessert Wine:</p>
            <p class="vibe-dessert">The Vibe: Cozy evenings, a good book in hand, and the warmth of a fireplace.</p>
            <p class="content-dessert">Dessert wines, as the name suggests, are a treat. Their sweetness and richness make them the perfect ending to a meal. A Port or Muscat paired with blue cheese creates a symphony of flavors, the sweetness of the wine cutting through the cheese's sharpness. Foie gras, with its creamy texture, finds its match in a Sauternes. And for dessert, whether it's a gooey chocolate cake or a fruit tart, a glass of dessert wine elevates the experience to pure indulgence.</p><br>

        <div class="fortified">
            <p class="title-fortified">Fortified Wine:</p>
            <p class="vibe-fortified">The Vibe: Vintage lounges, leather armchairs, and the rich aroma of history.</p>
            <p class="content-fortified">Fortified wines, with their added spirits, are intense and flavorful. Think of a Sherry or Madeira, their flavors deep and complex. They're perfect with hard cheeses, the wine's intensity complementing the cheese's aged flavors. Nuts, especially almonds or walnuts, paired with a fortified wine, make for a delightful snack. And for dessert, rich, fruity puddings or tarts find their match in the wine's depth.</p><br>
